# :ocean: HydroWave 

## :spiral_notepad: Website Description

**HydroWaves** is a full-stack web application that empowers users to report water observations in their community or wherever they travel. The platform allows users to create water observation reports by adding description, condtition, status, uploading photos, and pinpointing exact locations on an interactive map. Users can explore the community page to view reports from others, interact through comments, and engage in collaborative environmental reporting. The `Insights` page provides visual analytics, including a bar chart and a table filtered by water source and condition, respectively, along with AI-powered recommendations, enabling users to take informed actions that support environmental awareness and preservation.

Whether tracking a single water source or participating in broader community observations, the platform encourages proactive stewardship of local ecosystems through an intuitive, interactive interface.

> **Why this platform?** With a background in hydrogeology and water resources, I wanted to create a platform that connects people with the state of their local water sources. Instead of building a technical tool for specialists, HydroWave was designed to be intuitive and accessible, allowing anyone to report observations, share insights, and engage with the community. By empowering everyday users to contribute, the platform encourages collective awareness and action on a wide range of water-related issues, from environmental concerns to community stewardship.
